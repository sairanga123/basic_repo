# Creating a Listing

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

The recommended way to create listings is to use the [Create Listings for Requested Events][create-listing-endpoint]
endpoint. This endpoint accepts text values for all the event information (e.g. name, local date,
venue name, venue city and venue country) and the StubHub API will attempt to map this to an event
on the StubHub platform.

We recommend using this endpoint for creating listings so that your listing
can be created even if the event you are listing for does not exist on the StubHub platform yet.
The event will then get created asynchronously and go live on the platform with your listing
attached.

To prevent duplication of listings in our system due to race conditions, it is recommended that you
provide an `external_id` ( the Id of the listing in your system when creating a listing). If an
attempt is made to create a listing with an `external_id` that already exists for your user, then we
will delete the old listing and create the new one.

[create-listing-endpoint]: /api-reference/inventory/#operation/SellerListings_CreateListingForRequestedEvent

The following code creates a listing via this mechanism.

    config,
    new InMemoryOAuth2TokenStore());
await client.TokenStore.SetTokenAsync(new OAuth2Token() { AccessToken = token, ExpiresIn = int.MaxValue, IssueDate = DateTimeOffset.Now });
