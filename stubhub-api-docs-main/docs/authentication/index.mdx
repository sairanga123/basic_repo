# Authentication

The StubHub API uses OAuth2 for all authentication. OAuth2 is a protocol that
lets external applications access public StubHub resources and private StubHub
user details without getting their password.

**Tokens are passwords.**
Keep in mind that your application's Client ID and Client Secret and all access
tokens should be considered as sensitive as passwords and should not be shared.
